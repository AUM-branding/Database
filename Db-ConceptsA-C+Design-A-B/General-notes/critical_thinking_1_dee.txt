A data dictionary doesn’t need to just be an excel spreadsheet containing all the different datatypes for a database.
Especially as the database grows it would be very helpful to begin to include additional details related to the 
database that a newcomer can use to become acquainted to its intricacies. This begins to include detailed 
information about the tables columns, administration rights, and views. The dictionary should show keys, and will 
help to have details on what each key can link to for general review, or quick reference when accessing the database 
from a terminal, or command line, or in the case that a management GUI is not sufficient to do the work. If I were 
administering a database, I would keep a log location of backups, recent major changes, and a personal notes section 
pertaining to how I prefer to navigate and access different aspects of the database, and the why’s and how’s of why I
chose a specific method for a specific function. This ensures that all ends are tied properly, and keeps it in a 
state of “futureproof” for anyone potentially joining the team to work on the same database. This is crucial, 
because a database in general is not really meant to be a personal thing. In nearly all outcomes, I would expect that
you were hired for a role within the company, and that means that you must adhere to their needs. That includes 
ensuring that the database will not suddenly become inoperable should you choose to leave the company for a new role 
at a later point in time. The database is like the spine to most companies in this case, and this is why keeping 
detailed outlines is so important. A good data dictionary maintains a great deal for the future of the company, and 
for the programmer as well.
