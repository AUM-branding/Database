2. What is the most challenging aspect of using this report builder?
	- I found the layout to be slightly cumbersome with regards to column wrapping.
	The method for wrapping columns involves setting up filters which I opted against,
	otherwise you would need to utilize a newsletter matrix, according to some of the answers I found online.

3. Does using this tool help you to understand how important it is to build a database that is properly structured 
with correct datatypes, foreign keys, primary keys, etc.? Why or why not?
	- Of course. Using a report builder showed me how important it is to keep employees in mind while
	planning and programming a database and solution. It highlighted the usefulness of views as well. Not using
	proper types, or redundant names can cause the report builder to throw an error, and this isn't helpful
	for employees who may be reliant upon the builder that don't have SQL skills, or even access to the database.
