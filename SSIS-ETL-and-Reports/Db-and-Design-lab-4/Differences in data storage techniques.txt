A data lake is raw data. A data warehouse is fully structured, and contains filters and correlations that allow the 
data to be processed. Raw data has less redundancy, and the reliance is on the program to determine what to do with 
it, and processed data has many redundancies that cause the storage needs to be more robust, as each filter, or each 
complexity that gets added must be included with the data, as well as any separations that occurred to keep the data 
file-able.

A database is a specified singular use schema, where a data warehouse is more complex, yet dynamic as it allows data 
translation using a pre-determined schema that operates as a mark-up, and a data lake is not expected to adhere to 
any structure besides storing the data itself. I view databases as "in use", warehouses as "transcription", and 
lakes as "storage".

A data mart is a data warehouse that specializes in a certain subject matter. If it is not useful to use a database, 
or information is scattered across many databases, a company can build a data mart in order to maintain the 
information in a structured way.
